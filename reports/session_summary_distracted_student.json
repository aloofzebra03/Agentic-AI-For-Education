While a squirrel chasing its tail is certainly repetitive, oscillatory motion is a specific type of repetitive motion.\n\nHere's a concise definition:\n\n**Oscillatory motion is a repetitive back-and-forth movement around a central equilibrium point.**\n\nCan you restate that in your own words?"

Can you try to restate the whole definition in your own words, including the equilibrium point?"

Balancing a pencil is a good analogy for finding the equilibrium point, but it's not quite oscillatory motion *unless* it's repeatedly tilting back and forth around that balance point.

      "role": "assistant",

The basic principle remains the same: it's still moving back and forth around that central equilibrium point.\n\nNow, to explore this further, here's a question for you:\n\n**Why does the swing eventually stop moving if you *don't* keep pushing it? What forces are acting on it?**"
