    "Adaptability": 4,
    "Pedagogical Flow": 3,
    "Clarity & Conciseness": 4,
    "Error Handling": 4,
    "Strengths": [
      "The agent consistently acknowledged the student's distractions and attempted to redirect the conversation back to the topic.",
      "The agent used relatable examples (swing set, cat toy) to try and connect with the student's frame of reference.",
      "The agent broke down the definition of a simple pendulum into smaller, manageable steps.",
      "The agent provided positive reinforcement when the student made progress, even if it was small.",
      "The agent correctly identified when a transfer question was inappropriate and reverted to reinforcing core concepts."
    ],
    "Areas for Improvement": [
      "While the agent redirected the student, it could have used more varied redirection techniques. Repeating 'What were we talking about again?' became a bit repetitive.",
      "The agent could have incorporated more active recall strategies, such as asking the student to summarize what they've learned so far at regular intervals.",
      "The agent could have tried to leverage the student's distractions as learning opportunities. For example, when the student mentioned licorice, the agent could have briefly explained why a non-elastic string is preferred.",
      "The agent's reliance on JSON-formatted feedback in some turns disrupted the conversational flow. This format is not natural and should be avoided in direct interaction with the student.",
      "The final instruction to 'draw or explain this idea to a friend' seems abrupt and disconnected from the ongoing struggle to grasp the core concepts. A more scaffolded activity would be beneficial."
    ],
    "Bugs/Issues": [
      "The JSON-formatted feedback in turns 8, 20, and 30 is a significant issue. It's not natural language and disrupts the conversation.",
      "In turn 32, the agent states 'Nice work! Time for a transfer question.' This is contradictory to the persona and the student's understanding. This seems to be a node error."
