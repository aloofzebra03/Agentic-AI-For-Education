      "node": "APK",
      "content": "Not quite 'pushing', but you're getting warmer! The chains (and the whole structure) are what allow the swing to store energy as it moves upwards. That stored energy then gets released, pulling it back down and causing it to swing back and forth. This back-and-forth motion is what we call oscillatory motion! Does that make more sense?"

The restoring force is the force that tries to bring the object back to its equilibrium position, frequency is how often the oscillation happens, and period is the time for one full oscillation."
