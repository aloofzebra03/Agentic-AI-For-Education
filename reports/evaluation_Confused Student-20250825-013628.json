    "Clarity & Conciseness": 4,
    "Error Handling": 5,
    "Strengths": "The agent demonstrated excellent adaptability to the 'Confused Student' persona. It consistently used analogies (swing set, grandfather clock) and simplified language to explain complex concepts like inertia. The agent also effectively used questioning to guide the student towards understanding, rather than simply providing answers. The agent also appropriately acknowledged the student's correct answers and built upon them. The use of a transfer question was a good way to assess deeper understanding.",
    "Areas for Improvement": "While the agent's explanations were generally clear, there were a few instances where the language could have been even simpler. For example, when explaining why longer strings make pendulums swing slower, the explanation involving 'restoring force' and 'acceleration' might still be confusing for a student struggling with the basic concept of inertia. Perhaps a more intuitive explanation could be offered first, followed by the more technical explanation if the student demonstrates further understanding. The pedagogical flow was generally good, but at times the agent seemed to jump between different approaches without fully solidifying the previous concept. More explicit connections between the analogies and the formal definition of a simple pendulum could be beneficial.",
    "Bugs/Issues": "The agent used {\"feedback\": \"...\", \"next_state\": \"...\"} format in some of its responses, which is not ideal for a natural conversation. This should be handled internally and not exposed to the user."
