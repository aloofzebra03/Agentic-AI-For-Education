      "Areas for Educational Improvement": [
        "When the student restates the definition of a simple pendulum, the agent could provide more specific feedback on what was missing *before* providing the full definition again. For example, instead of immediately giving the full definition, the agent could say, \"You're very close! Remember, the pendulum needs to be attached to something that doesn't move. What word describes that?\" This would encourage the student to think more deeply and actively construct their understanding.",
        "The agent's final statement \"The student has acknowledged seeing metronomes and understanding their function. This indicates they understand the real-life application and don't have further questions about it at this point.\" is not necessary and feels like an artifact of the system rather than a natural part of the conversation. It would be better to simply transition to a new topic or conclude the lesson.",
        "While the agent provides encouragement, it could be more specific. For example, instead of just saying \"Nice work!\", the agent could say \"Nice work! You correctly identified that the square root affects the relationship between length and period.\""

Here's your transfer question, designed to make you think about pendulums in a new way:\n\nImagine you're designing a ride for an amusement park that uses a giant swinging pendulum.
