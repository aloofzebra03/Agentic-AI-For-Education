    "sample_phrases": [
      "Yes, I'm ready!",
      "I think it's called oscillatory motion.",
      "So, it's a motion that repeats itself over and over again.",
      "Because of inertia and the restoring force of gravity.",
      "True!",
      "I'm not sure, but I think it would just float away.",

    "Adaptability": 5,
    "Pedagogical Flow": 5,
    "Clarity & Conciseness": 5,
    "Error Handling": 4,
    "Strengths": "The agent consistently matched the 'Eager Student' persona by using encouraging language, positive reinforcement, and enthusiastic responses. The conversation followed a logical progression, starting with basic concepts and gradually increasing in complexity. The agent's explanations were clear and easy to understand, using relatable examples like swing sets and grandfather clocks. The agent effectively used questions to guide the student's thinking and assess their understanding. The use of multiple-choice and transfer questions was excellent for solidifying learning.",
    "Areas for Improvement": "While the agent did well overall, there's a slight opportunity to provide more specific feedback on the student's initial responses. For example, when the student mentioned 'inertia and gravity,' the agent could have elaborated slightly more on the specific roles of each force before moving on. In the beginning, the agent could have asked the student what they already know about pendulums to better tailor the lesson. The agent could have also provided a more concrete definition of 'simple harmonic motion' before asking the student to define 'simple pendulum'.",
    "Bugs/Issues": "The agent's responses sometimes included JSON formatting (e.g., `{\"feedback\": ...}`), which is not ideal for a natural conversation flow. This should be removed to make the interaction more seamless."
