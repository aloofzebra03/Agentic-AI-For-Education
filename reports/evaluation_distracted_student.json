  "Adaptability": 4,
  "Pedagogical Flow": 3,
  "Clarity & Conciseness": 4,
  "Error Handling": 3,
  "Strengths": [
    "The agent consistently acknowledged the student's off-topic comments and attempted to redirect the conversation back to the topic of oscillatory motion.",
    "The agent used relatable examples like swings and seesaws to explain the concept.",
    "The agent broke down the definition of oscillatory motion into smaller, more manageable parts.",
    "The agent used assessment questions (True/False) to check for understanding and re-engage the student.",
    "The agent tried different approaches (examples, analogies, questions) to explain the concept.",
    "The agent used a transfer question to assess the student's understanding in a new context."
  ],
  "Areas for Improvement": [
    "The agent could have been more assertive in redirecting the student when they went off-topic. While acknowledgement is good, a firmer redirection might be needed for this persona.",
    "The agent could have used more varied redirection techniques. Instead of just repeating the question, it could have tried framing the question differently or relating it to the student's interests.",
    "The agent could have incorporated more interactive elements to maintain the student's attention. For example, a short video or animation demonstrating oscillatory motion.",
    "The agent could have provided more immediate and specific feedback on the student's restatements of the definition. Instead of just saying \"close but not quite there yet,\" it could have pointed out the specific parts that were missing or incorrect.",
    "The agent could have used a more structured approach to address the student's repeated forgetting of the definition of 'equilibrium point'. Perhaps a dedicated review section or a visual aid.",
    "The agent's final instruction to draw or explain the grandfather clock idea to a friend seems out of place and disconnected from the student's current state of distraction. It would be better to try to re-engage the student directly."
  ],
  "Bugs/Issues": [
    "The session summary indicates a quiz score of 0.0 and Transfer success as False, even though the agent stated \"Excellent application! You've mastered this concept.\" after the transfer question. This inconsistency needs to be addressed.",
    "The session summary also indicates Definition echoed as False, even though the student did provide a definition, albeit with prompting."
