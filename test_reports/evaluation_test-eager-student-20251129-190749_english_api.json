      "Pedagogical Strengths": [
        "The agent effectively used a step-by-step approach, breaking down the complex concept of Brahmagupta's method into smaller, manageable parts (changing a, b, c, d individually).",
        "The agent used real-world examples (baking, gardening, bookshelf space) to connect the abstract mathematical concept to the student's life, enhancing understanding and engagement.",
        "The agent actively encouraged the student to restate the method in their own words, promoting deeper understanding and retention.",
        "The agent provided immediate positive reinforcement and encouragement, motivating the student to continue learning.",
        "The agent effectively identified and corrected misconceptions, providing clear explanations and alternative perspectives.",

      "Areas for Educational Improvement": [
        "The agent initially skipped a question designed to assess the student's understanding of changing 'b', which could have led to a gap in knowledge. While this was corrected, it highlights the importance of consistently following the planned assessment strategy.",
        "The agent could have provided more visual aids or interactive simulations to further enhance the student's understanding of how changing the variables affects the overall result. For example, a slider that changes the value of 'a' and shows the resulting change in the fraction.",
        "While the agent used real-world examples, it could have encouraged the student to generate their own examples, further personalizing the learning experience and solidifying understanding."
