Brahmagupta's method is essentially doing the same steps as the common denominator method, but it skips the explicit step of rewriting each fraction with the common denominator *separately*. It directly calculates the new numerator ($ad + bc$) and the new denominator ($bd$).\n\nSo, Brahmagupta's method is a shortcut that combines the steps of finding the common denominator and adjusting the numerators into a single calculation.\n\nNow let's see how well you understand this concept with a quick question.",
