And yes, it absolutely has to do with the particles!\n\nWhen we heat food to 165\u00b0F, the particles (molecules) within the food and, crucially, within any bacteria or germs present, gain a lot of kinetic energy. They start moving much faster and vibrating more intensely.\n\nThis increased energy and motion directly affects the structure of the bacteria:\n*   **Protein Denaturation:** Bacteria, like all living things, are made up of complex proteins. These proteins have very specific 3D shapes that allow them to perform their functions (like metabolism, reproduction, etc.). When exposed to high temperatures, the intense vibrations and collisions from the fast-moving water molecules and other particles in the food cause these delicate protein structures to **denature**. Think of it like a finely crafted origami bird being crumpled up \u2013 it loses its shape and can no longer fly or function.\n*   **Cell Membrane Disruption:** The outer protective layer of bacteria, called the cell membrane, is also made of molecules that can be damaged by high heat. This damage can cause the cell to leak its contents or break apart, effectively killing the bacterium.\n*   **Enzyme Inactivation:** Enzymes are special proteins that act as catalysts for all the chemical reactions necessary for life. High temperatures destroy these enzymes, stopping all vital processes within the bacteria.\n\nSo, while it might not be \"breaking apart\" in the sense of shattering into tiny pieces, it's more about the high energy from the fast-moving particles causing irreversible damage to the essential structures and molecules within the bacteria, rendering them inactive or dead. This is why reaching that specific temperature for a certain amount of time is so critical for food safety!\n\nGreat!
