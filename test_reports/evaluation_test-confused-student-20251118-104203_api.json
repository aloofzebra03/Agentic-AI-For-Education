It's about proving or disproving a hypothesis. Maybe our initial understanding is wrong, or maybe the effect is so small we need to test it carefully to see if it's even there.\n\nSo, even though I've hinted that mass doesn't significantly affect the swing time, let's treat this as an investigation.
