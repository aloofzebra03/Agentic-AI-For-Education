      "Areas for Educational Improvement": [
        "The pace of instruction could be slower, given the student's persona. More time should be spent on each concept before moving on.",

        "The agent could explicitly address the student's frustration and lack of motivation more directly.",
        "The agent could use more varied questioning techniques to assess understanding beyond simple recall.",
        "The agent introduces the concept of Brahmagupta's method too early. The student does not have a firm grasp on adding fractions with common denominators, let alone different denominators. More time should be spent on this foundational concept before introducing a more complex method.",
        "The agent should have identified that the student only partially understood the effect of 'b' on the final answer. Instead, it moved on to the next concept."

This means you multiply the numerator of the first fraction (a) by the denominator of the second fraction (d), then multiply the denominator of the first fraction (b) by the numerator of the second fraction (c). You add those two results together to get the new numerator. Then, you multiply the two original denominators (b and d) to get the new denominator.**\n\nIt's okay if you struggled with that!

That's because in Brahmagupta's formula (ad + bc) / bd, 'a' is multiplied by 'd'. So, if 'a' increases, the whole 'ad' part increases, which makes the entire numerator (ad + bc) increase. Since the numerator gets bigger while the denominator stays the same, the overall fraction gets bigger. Great job!\n\nNow let's see how well you understand this concept with a quick question.",
