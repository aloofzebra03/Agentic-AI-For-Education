While the heavier bob has more inertia (resistance to movement), gravity also pulls on it with more force. These two effects *cancel each other out* when it comes to the swing time.\n\nSo, even though it might seem counterintuitive, changing the weight of the bob *doesn't* actually change how long it takes for the pendulum to swing back and forth!

This is a bit surprising, right? It means whether you start it from a little height or a big height, it takes about the same amount of time for one complete swing.\n\nSo, to answer your question indirectly, yes, you're essentially \"pushing\" it more when you start it higher, but the swing time doesn't really change because of it.\n\nDoes that make sense?",
