However, it could also make the edge of the shadow less defined, or blurrier, especially if the sun is very bright. A shorter gnomon will cast a shorter shadow, which might be harder to see, but *could* be sharper. The \"best\" height depends on the size of the dial and how far away you'll be viewing it.

The *angle* of the dial plate needs to be set so that it matches the angle of the sun's path across the sky at that location.

If the hill's angle unintentionally corrects for an error in the sundial's initial setup, it *could* work, but it's highly unlikely and not the intended method.\n\nGreat!
