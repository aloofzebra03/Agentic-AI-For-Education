    "Qualitative Feedback": {
      "Pedagogical Strengths": "The agent correctly identified the student's difficulty with finding a common denominator, which is a common hurdle in fraction addition. The agent also attempted to connect the student's existing knowledge to a new method (Brahmagupta's method).",
      "Areas for Educational Improvement": "The conversation is still very high-level. While acknowledging the difficulty with common denominators is good, the agent doesn't yet delve into *why* it's difficult or offer concrete strategies for overcoming that difficulty. Introducing Brahmagupta's method at this stage, without further explanation or context, might be premature and confusing for a 'Dull Student'. The agent should focus on solidifying the understanding of common denominators before introducing alternative methods. The agent could also probe deeper into *why* the student finds common denominators 'stupid'. Is it the process of finding multiples? Is it understanding the equivalence of fractions? Addressing the root cause would be more effective.",
      "Technical Issues": "None apparent.",
      "Persona Alignment": "The agent acknowledges the student's reluctance and uses informal language ('You're on the right track!'). However, it could be more patient and break down the concepts into even smaller, more manageable steps. The introduction of Brahmagupta's method, without sufficient scaffolding, might be overwhelming for this persona."
