While a wider vessel *does* allow more water molecules to pass through at the same time, another important factor is **the reduced resistance to flow**. Water molecules experience friction as they move along the walls of the xylem vessel. In a narrower vessel, a larger proportion of the water is in contact with the walls, leading to greater friction and slower flow.

However, let's clarify a little. While it's true that water loss from leaves (transpiration) *does* affect the water being pulled up, it's not quite as simple as just \"water pulled up.\"\n\nThink of it this way: **Transpiration creates a \"pulling\" force (tension) at the top of the xylem, which helps draw water up from the roots.** The more water that's lost through transpiration, the stronger this pulling force becomes. It's like sucking on a straw \u2013 the harder you suck (more transpiration), the more liquid gets pulled up.\n\nNow let's see how well you understand this concept with a quick question.",
