      "detail": "Long before digital watches, humans used nature to measure time. They noticed that certain events repeat at regular intervals—this is called **periodic motion**. Examples include the rising sun (day), phases of the moon (month), and seasons (year). \n\nTo measure shorter intervals, they invented devices like:\n1. **Sundials:** Used the changing position of shadows caused by the sun.\n2. **Water Clocks:** Measured time by the flow of water into or out of a vessel.\n3. **Sand Clocks (Hourglasses):** Used the flow of sand from one bulb to another.",
