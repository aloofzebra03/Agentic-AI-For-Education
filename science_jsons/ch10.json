Plants take in carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil to produce glucose (a simple carbohydrate) and oxygen[cite: 213, 256]. The leaves are known as the 'food factories' of the plant because this is where the process primarily takes place[cite: 170]. The green pigment called chlorophyll helps capture the energy from sunlight to drive this chemical reaction[cite: 96, 169].",

        "3. Chlorophyll in the leaves traps energy from sunlight.",
        "4. Using this energy, the plant converts water and carbon dioxide into glucose (food) and releases oxygen[cite: 258].",
