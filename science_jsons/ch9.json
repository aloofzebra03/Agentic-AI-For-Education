It consists of the alimentary canal (a long tube starting from the mouth and ending at the anus) and associated glands like the liver and pancreas. The process involves ingestion, digestion (mechanical and chemical), absorption of nutrients in the small intestine, and egestion of waste.",

        "3. Stomach: Churns food with acid and enzymes to break down proteins and kill bacteria.",
        "4. Small Intestine: Receives bile (from liver) and pancreatic juice (from pancreas) to complete digestion. Villi absorb nutrients into the blood.",
